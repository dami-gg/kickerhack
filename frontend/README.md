# Kicker Hack

## Development

Most of the webapp's functionality can be tested in the browser during development.
    
    gulp watch

Some of the stuff (check-in and OAuth login) are only working when deployed to a mobile device (be sure to enable USB-Debugging on your device).

  gulp --cordova 'run android'

## Building and Deploying

Use the `release.sh` script to prepare the deployment.
